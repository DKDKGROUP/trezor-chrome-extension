  <p>Would you like myTREZOR to forget your device or to remember it, so that
  it is still visible even while disconnected?</p>
  <p class="text-muted">If you choose to remember the device, we will not ask
  you this question next time you disconnect the device.</p>
  <p class="text-muted">Forgetting only removes the device from the list 
  on the left, your bitcoins are still safe and you can access them by 
  reconnecting your Trezor again.</p>
